# German Credit Risk

**_Disclaimer:_** The dataset used for this project is outdated and cannot be used for use today. It was originally collected during the mid 1990s, shortly after the reunification of Germany. Thus, it is likely to give us a skewed look of the typical customer base at the time, given the likely influx of new customers coming from newly unified side. For example, a bank located in Western Germany may see a influx of Eastern Germans applying for credit lines now that they are able to freely travel across what used to be the Eastern/Western Germany border. Moreover, the currency used at the time was the Deutsche Mark, predating their adoption of the Euro.

**_Goal:_** The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset containing the financial records of the bank's customers in order to predict whether a new customer would be considered "good" or "bad". This consideration is important since it gives us an insight into whether the potential customer is likely to repay their loan or default. To achieve this, we want to create a model to predict the probability a customer is likely to default on a loan instead of only predicting whether the customer will be a "good" or "bad" one. Assuming the model is adequate, this allows the lenders to spend less resources on the "good" customers who are likely to repay their loan and focus on the ones likely to default according to the model.
